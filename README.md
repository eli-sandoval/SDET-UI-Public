## How to run
In order to run the tests, the following environment variables need to be set:
-Dtimeout = 15 (15 is the timeout with which I have worked)
-Dpath.to.chromedriver = The path to the chromedriver executable with which the tests will run
After that, you can simply right click on the results_page_tests.xml file and run as a TestNG class.

As a Customer we want to see if the second ad from the second results page when searching for "Iphone" on www.aliexpress.com has at least 1 item to be bought.
